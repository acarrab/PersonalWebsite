    <p>
      Angelo Carrabba is a Computer and Mathematical Sciences Student
      at Clemson university with an interest in things like object
      oriented design, web design, machine learning, and advanced
      algorithmic problems.

    <p> He also participate in programming contests, but would not
    consider that to be his focus (although he considers them to be
      very fun). </p>

    <p> A lot of the things that I have done in my my undergrad are
    pretty varied, but have normally leaned towards research in the
    past. However, this summer I will be interning
    at <a href="https://www.blackbaud.com/">Blackbaud</a> in
    Charleston, South Carolina this summer, which will introduce me
    more with software engineering. </p>
