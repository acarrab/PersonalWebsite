  <h2>Data Science Project <small>Semantic Analysis With Stock Trends</small></h2>
  <p> For this project, we will be applying some semantic analysis to
  bloomberg news articles in order to see how their attitude
  correlates with future changes with stock data for a specific
  company. We are doing a specific company first in order to simplify
  the problem before expanding it to be more complicated.</p>
