    <p> For this project, I was responsible for generating simulations for
        multi-robot environments. These simulations would be used in order to
        determine if there are any sharp-transitions in the behavior of
        multi-robot systems when the constraints of the system changed,
        specifically the locality and density of robots in the system.</p>

    <p> Overall, I looked at three different scenarios under these constraints:
        Continuous, Discrete, and Discrete with Collision avoidance. Often times
        problems that have to do with a continuous amount of possibilities is
        simplified to a discrete case to stop it from being able to be solved in
        a reasonable amount of time, so that was why continuous with path
        planning was not done.</p>

    <p> In the end, it was determined that there were no sharp transitions in
        the specific environments and scenarios that I explored. Further
        research can be done to see what types of properties would lead to such
        transitions, but as of now my simulations and path determination
        algorithm do not create sharp transitions. </p>

    <h3><br>Final week and a Research Paper</h3>
    <h6><i>Week 9</i></h6>
    <p> This week, I am continuing to write my final research paper based upon
        the results that were found. I would like to thank DIMACS and NSF for
        the funding that I received and also for the great Summer of Research
        that I had; it was an unforgettable experience.</p>

    <h3>Final data collection</h3>
    <h6><i>Week 8</i></h6>
    <p> This week, I am collecting more data. Also, working on writing the final
        research paper and the summary of my experience in the program.</p>


    <h3>Lack of a sharp transition</h3>
    <h6><i>Week 7</i></h6>
    <p> This week, I worked more with locality and discovered moreso how it
        affects the number of collisions overall. There were no unexpected
        results however and there was also no perceiveable sharp transition. So
        far it seems like I would have to increase the sophistication for the
        collision avoidance to get a sharp transition. </p>

    <h3>Locality and disc radius</h3>
    <h6><i>Week 6</i></h6>
    <p> This week, I worked more on data collection and exploring the solution.
        I implemented the locality based on edge distance generation for
        starting and ending nodes for the discs. I also collected data based on
        the locality and total discs in the environment as without the locality
        the results were predictable and there was no sharp transition. </p>

    <h3>More Data and more deterministic</h3>
    <h6><i>Week 5</i></h6>
    <p> I gathered basic data on the collision behavior, but the more random
        method of determining solutions to the problem caused a few problems
        with the speed of solving and thus the speed of collecting data. I
        worked this week on making the process deterministic. I also collected
        some more data. </p>

    <h3>Trying out the GPU</h3>
    <h6><i>Week 4</i></h6>
    <p> This week, I generated graphs based on how the locality of travel and
        density of the discs area in a unit square affect the number of
        collisions. Using plot.ly along with python, I was able to run
        simulations on the number of pairwise collisions. In the system there
        appeared to be no sharp transitions </p>


    <h3>I now have graphs</h3>
    <h6><i>Week 3</i></h6>
    <p> This week, I generated graphs based on how the locality of travel and
        density of the discs area in a unit square affect the number of
        collisions. Using plot.ly along with python, I was able to run
        simulations on the number of pairwise collisions. In the system there
        apeared to be no sharp transitions. </p>

    <h3>Onwards!</h3>
    <h6><i>Week 2</i></h6>
    <p> This week, I ran simulations to determine how the properties of the
        system affected the interaction between the discs. The results of this
        step are so far inconclusive since no sharp transition was found yet. I
        set up python andpygame within visual studios and then started to work
        in/learn python to create a grid for the discs to be on. This will be
        useful later for creating models with pygame. </p>


    <h3>Start of the Program</h3>
    <h6><i>Week 1</i></h6>
    <p> This week I worked on putting together a presentation as well as making
        some headway into gathering data on how the number of discs, the radius,
        and maximum distance from starting point to ending point affect the
        number of pairwise collisions that occur. I layed out a plan for what I
        am going to be researching as well as getting my workspace organized and
        set up for working. I met with my mentor, Jingjin Yu, and we layed out
        moreso what I will be starting with.</p>
