  <h2>Door Lock Control <small>Software to communicate with door lock</small></h2>
  <hr>
  <p> My friends and I developed an android application for controlling
    a locking mechanism for a door. The application gains secure access to
    an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2821">Adafruit Feather
      HUZZAH with ESP8266 WiFI</a>. The purpose of using this device is to
    connect to the door lock via wifi or anywhere as long as you have access
    to the internet.</p>
  <p> My friend <a href="https://christiansteinmetz.com">Christian Steinmetz</a> is
    an electrical engineering and audio technology major at Clemson
    University. We split up the work based on my background in coding and
    his in hardware and coding for microcontrollers.

  <p> Originally, we started the project using the Lua programming language
    along with the <a href="https://www.nodemcu.com/index_en.html">nodeMCU</a> as
    the language for the microcontroller, but we switched the code to
    <a href="https://micropython.org/">MicroPython</a>, because we were
    encountering problems that were common with Nodemcu's ssl library and
    also micro python seemed like a really cool and generally more well
    supported language.
