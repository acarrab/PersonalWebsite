  <h2>IOT Universal Control <small>Communicates with generic IOT devices</small></h2>
  <hr>
  <p> This application will be able to interface with generic things on
    a persons network that follow the same protocol. This is done in
    order to stop the repetitve app creation for similar applications.</p>
  <p> This is an offshoot of the Door Lock Control application, in which
    the holding of layout of the application will be retrieved when
    necessary. The devices will have an associated device ID. When
    the device ID is received from devices on the local network,
    the devices User Interface for interacting with it is downloaded.</p>
  <p> There device only has control of what the interace looks like and
    what is sent to the device when an element is interacted with.
    I intend to eventually add more control elements to interact with
    different in a standardized and secure way, so that every time
    a person creates a new thing, they do not have to worry about
    developing a new application. </p>
