    <p> This has my configuration files for emacs. It includes a lot
    of customization type stuff that I liked or stubled across. The
    configuration file is written then compiled with org-babel, which
    combines the mark-up language org-mode with elisp code (and other
    code if required). </p>
    <p> The configuration file, named loader.org, that is loaded in
    the init of emacs is actually concatenated with the readme so that
    it is on the front page of the github repository. Feel free to
    visit my github to get more info. </p>
