    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p> A decent bit of my undergrad time at Clemson has been spent on the research side of the computer science. This year I applied and accepted an internship at <a href="https://www.blackbaud.com/">Blackbaud</a>. Over the 3 month program, I worked along side software engineers on a scrum team. The product we worked on was an ASP.NET web apllication with a front-end written with f Angular1/2..</p>
